Hello, my name is Nazerke and I am a novice researcher. 


I was born, raised, and got my undergraduate degree in **Kazakhstan**. My educational background includes an **MSc in Data Science and BSc in Robotics**. My research fits in the broad area of control theory. Currently, I am doing a research internship at **Max Planck Institute for Software Systems(of Kaiserslautern)** on classical and logic-based control theory.



I like traveling and being in nature. In my spare time, I read or just go to places with beautiful scenery.
